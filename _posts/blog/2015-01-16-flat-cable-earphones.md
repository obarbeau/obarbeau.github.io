The last time that I went to the market,
I lost my audio headset.
I bought some smoked haddock that day,
which has proved very good,
but this is not the subject of this post.

In order to continue to listen to Opeth, Marillion and Kamelot
in the bus that brings me to work,
I bought a *Klipsch Image S4* headset.
The sound is very good, with powerful and satisfactory bass.

One silly thing and yet very pleasant,
are the flat cables, which do not intertwine.
It is a pleasure every morning
to quickly be able to listen to his music,
without losing 10 minutes to curse the ball of yarn.

By looking for the link on the site of the manufacturer,
I realize that this headset is already no more sold,
and that he has been replaced by [this one].
