I just spent the morning to sort paper records
that were sleeping over my office box.
I should say throwing them, because indeed the trash is now overflowing.
I kept very little documentation.

Finally all these paper records have little interest.
Most are intermediate versions of documents;
so there are 'final' versions elsewhere, often electronic ones.
When looking at those files
one takes the 'risk' to miss the latest information.

Others are printed emails, which are anyway stored in the mail box.

Finally, the rest are outdated notes or whose ideas were echoed elsewhere.

I only kept the documents relating to actions actually in progress,
or whose notes have not been written in electronic form,
as well as original bills.

Zero paper is on track.
